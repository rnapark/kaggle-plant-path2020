* Conducted systematic hyperparameter tuning using validation data or cross-validation (evidence: comparison of multiple configurations) 

* Implemented data augmentation appropriate to your data modality (evidence: code + evaluation of impact)

* Implemented preprocessing pipeline handling data quality issues (addresses class imbalance, missing data, outliers, text tokenization, image resizing, with evidence of impact)

* Compared multiple optimizers (e.g., SGD vs Adam vs AdamW) with documented evaluation

* Performed error analysis with visualization or discussion of failure cases (5 pts)

* Compared multiple model architectures or approaches quantitatively

* Conducted both qualitative and quantitative evaluation with thoughtful discussion

* Conducted ablation study demonstrating impact of at least two design choices with quantitative comparison
