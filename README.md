# Plant Pathology: Identifying foliar diseases in apple trees

My project was working on a 2020 Kaggle competition, which involved identifying the type of foliar diseases in apple trees from images of their leaves. 

## What it does
My project uses a convolutional neural network architecture via transfer learning on a ResNet34 to identify the presence of/type of foliar disease in apple trees from images of leaves. I fine-tuned the pre-trained model to be able to distinguish differences in condition despite variations in depth, lighting, and symptoms. Improving the efficiency and accuracy of detecting crop diseases using an ML model can minimize the cost of resources that goes into environmental monitoring as well as economic loss and environmental impacts.
